# marccsman
Have you ever been in the situation where you needed to benchmark a bunch of key/value stores, but you didn't want to write the same code over and over again? Well, I have. And that's why I created marccsman. It's a simple tool that allows you to benchmark a bunch of key/value stores with a single command. It's written in C++, since most KV's are written in C++ as well. It's also very easy to add new key/value stores to the benchmark. Check the documentation below.

## Installation

```bash
git clone git@github.com:danielsp45/marccsman.git
cd marccsman
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j
```
